Storj is building a decentralized cloud storage network. 
[Check out our white paper for more info!](https://storj.io/white-paper)

----

Storj is an S3-compatible platform and suite of decentralized applications that
allows you to store data in a secure and decentralized manner. Your files are
encrypted, broken into little pieces and stored in a global decentralized
network of computers. Luckily, we also support allowing you (and only you) to
retrieve those files!

### Issue tracking and roadmap

See the breakdown of what we're building by checking out the following resources:

 * [White paper](https://storj.io/white-paper)
 * [Aha! Roadmap](https://storjlabs.aha.io/published/01ee405b4bd8d14208c5256d70d73a38)
 * [Jira Issues](https://storjlabs.atlassian.net/projects/V3)

### Install required packages

To get started running Storj locally, download and install the latest release of Go (at least Go 1.11) at [golang.org](https://golang.org).

You will also need [Git](https://git-scm.com/). (`brew install git`, `apt-get install git`, etc).
If you're building on Windows, you also need to install and have [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/install/binaries.html) setup correctly.

We support Linux, Mac, and Windows operating systems. Other operating systems supported by Go should also be able to run Storj.

### Download and compile Storj

> **Aside about GOPATH**: Go 1.11 supports a new feature called Go modules,
> and Storj has adopted Go module support. If you've used previous Go versions,
> Go modules no longer require a GOPATH environment variable. Go by default
> falls back to the old behavior if you check out code inside of the directory
> referenced by your GOPATH variable, so make sure to use another directory,
> `unset GOPATH` entirely, or set `GO111MODULE=on` before continuing with these
> instructions.

First, fork our repo and clone your copy of our repository.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/storj storj
cd storj
```

Then, let's install Storj.

```bash
go install -v ./cmd/...
```

### Make changes and test

Make the changes you want to see! Once you're done, you can run all of the unit tests:

```bash
go test -v ./...
```

You can also execute only a single test package if you like. For example:
`go test ./pkg/kademlia`. Add `-v` for more informations about the executed unit
tests.

### Push up a pull request

Use Git to push your changes to your fork:

```bash
git commit -a -m 'my changes!'
git push origin master
```

Use Github to open a pull request!
