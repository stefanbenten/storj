# gRPC Client + BoltDB Crud Interface

This is an example gRPC client which makes CRUD requests (create, read, update, delete) for storing pointers at given paths in BoltDB.

The gRPC server at `storj.io/storj/cmd/pointerdb/main.go` needs to be running for this to work.

To run the client:
```
go run examples/pointerdb-client/main.go
```
You can change the port number with a flag if necessary: `-port=<port-number>`

Afterward, you can use [Bolter](https://github.com/hasit/bolter) or a similar BoltDB viewer to make sure your pointer entries were changed as expected.

If changes are made to `storj.io/storj/pkg/pb/pointerdb.proto`, the protobuf file will need to be regenerated by running `go generate` inside `pkg/pb`.

Tests for this example code can be found in `storj.io/storj/pkg/pointerdb/client_test.go`.
